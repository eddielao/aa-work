# Basic Intro

Within the statement `System.Console.WriteLine("This is cool!")`;, `System` is a namespace. A **namespace** is a construct that acts like a container to provide a way to group similar classes.

The keyword `void` is used in the `Main()` method header to indicate that the method does not return any value when called.

All "keywords" in C# are lower case. So to avoid using them as identifiers, always try to utilize camel casing. The tricky part comes when the identifiers contain only one word.

Single line comments start with double forward slashes, `//`, while multi-line comments are enclose within `/*` and `*/`.
